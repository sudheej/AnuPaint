# AnuPaint
Create 3d art intutively using mouse or pen by creating lines thin lines over the screen, the tool is quiet intutive and is a prototype at this stage.

Feel free to fork and use in your projects, its was written long back in 2013 and it might not be 100% standardized code :) it works. 

Enjoy.
